          Explanation:
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Fire Progression Visualization Tool was developed as part of the Center for Ecosystem Climate Solutions (CECS),
            the project is supported by the California Strategic Growth Council's Climate Change Research Program, it's funded by the California Climate Investmentsâ€”Cap-and-Trade Dollars at Work. 
          </li>
          <li> 
            The CECS Fire Behavior dataset captures daily fire spread for all large, 
            multi-day fires in California from 2012-2021 using active fire detections from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard the Suomi-National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite. This standardized database includes both daily fire spread rate and fire radiative power, the radiative energy emitted from fire. It will be regularly updated to include more recent fire years.
          <li>  
            The visualization tool only depicts 34 of the largest fires in the dataset.
            VIIRS provides global measurements for the energy radiated from the Earth's surface every day. 
            Hotspots in this data, where the energy radiated from the Earth is high, 
            can be used to identify fires. 
            By drawing a perimeter around detections of the same fire as it grows from day to day, 
            researchers can measure the distance between daily perimeters in order to calculate the fire's daily spread rate.
          </li>
          <li>  
            This dataset is set up to match VIIRS fire detections with fires represented in CAL FIRE's Fire and 
            Resource Assessment Program (FRAP) database for coherence between both. 
            Cross-referencing fires with FRAP provides a control for VIIRS detections of high-heat emissions from non-fire sources like industrial activity. 
            Only fires active for more than one day were included because measuring daily fire spread using VIIRS requires comparisons of fire perimeters from multiple days of detections.
            
            Because this method relies on comparing the VIIRS fire detections from day to day to measure rate of spread, this dataset cannot assess a fire's rate of spread. Also, very slow rate of spread is difficult to detect due to the relatively coarse spatial resolution of the data (375m), and heavy cloud cover can periodically prevent detections. Finally, the spread of more scattered fires, such as grass fires in desert landscapes where fires occur in patchy, less uniform patterns, are difficult to measure using this method.
            
            This dataset adds to our understanding not only of area burned but also fire behavior. 
            Paired with climate data and information about a fire's cause, 
            this data allows scientists to fill in gaps about overall ecosystem impacts of fire. 
            For example, CECS researchers have found that human caused fires are exhibiting more explosive growth in the first few days after ignition than those caused by lightning, 
            leading to higher tree mortality (Hantson et al.
2022.
