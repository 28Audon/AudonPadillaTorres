              “Moreover, such changes are highly unlikely to be restricted to the suite of species examined here, and can reasonably be expected to occur across species yet unstudied.
              Such widespread change will, over time, cause substantial changes in ecosystem structure and func-tion.
              Local or regional loss of canopy-forming kelps caused by de-clining rates of survival and growth can affect local biodiversity through loss of structural habitat (Arkema et al. 2009), and poten-tially alter other ecosystem services provided by kelp (Norderhaug et al., 2020); although kelps had high positive responses in meta-bolic rate, it is unclear how these will interact with declines in sur-vival and growth.
              Increased growth and consumption rates in two invertebrate species with strong interactions, red urchins (reviewed in Rogers- Bennett,2007) and ochre stars (Paine, 1966), could have large knock-on effects on nearshore food webs if left unchecked, as observed in the 2014 sea star wasting disease epidemic, in which ochre stars and their predation rates declined (Menge et al., 2016).”

              Changes are predicted to happen to the biogeochemical process (any natural pathways by which essential elements of living matter are circulated) and the marine ecosystem structure and function; due to changes in the ocean pH, temperature, and oxygen concentration.

              “Earth’s warming climate is causing heat waves to become more frequent, longer lasting, and hotter, while occurring in locations unaccustomed to such weather events.
              Extreme heat events (EHEs), such as those in the western United States, India, Pakistan, Central Europe, and other locations in recent years, are one of the deadliest consequences of climate change.
              EHEs cause excess morbidity and mortality directly from heat illness, aggravation of comorbid conditions, and exacerbation of the damaging health effects of social factors as well as indirectly from corollary events such as wildfires and air pollution.
              Climate change–related EHEs are projected to worsen for at least the next 3 decades, necessitating that health systems be prepared to meet a growing burden of heat-related illnesses and become more heat resilient, as well as to reduce health care–related climate impacts.
              In this article, the authors discuss the health effects of EHEs and provide illustrative examples of what health systems can do to promote climate readiness and heat resiliency.”
