              Local or regional loss of canopy-forming kelps caused by de-clining rates of survival and growth can affect local biodiversity through loss of structural habitat (Arkema et al. 2009), and poten-tially alter other ecosystem services provided by kelp (Norderhaug et al., 2020); although kelps had high positive responses in meta-bolic rate, it is unclear how these will interact with declines in sur-vival and growth.
              Increased growth and consumption rates in two invertebrate species with strong interactions, red urchins (reviewed in Rogers- Bennett,2007) and ochre stars (Paine, 1966), could have large knock-on effects on nearshore food webs if left unchecked, as observed in the 2014 sea star wasting disease epidemic, in which ochre stars and their predation rates declined (Menge et al., 2016).”

            Their is a loss in biodiversity due to a loss in kelp.
            Changes are predicted to happen to the biogeochemical process (any natural pathways by which essential elements of living matter are circulated) and the marine ecosystem structure and function; due to changes in the ocean pH, temperature, and oxygen concentration.
